Project Brief
Let's work on a simple version of Google News, built using News API. This application will show the latest news to the user.

In order to complete this assignment, the coder is going to have to have a good knowledge of interacting with APIs, and how to use Objects and Arrays.

Instructions to Get Started
Set up a new Repository, with a nice README.md
From here on out, in your GitHub projects, you should have a clean, consistent README.md file that is actually useful. Use this template for this, and all future homework assignments: CoderSchool Template. To copy and paste this into your project, use the raw link.

Notes
Please follow proper Git hygiene. That means: working in feature branches, creating pull requests, and merging them back into master.

This is an individual assignment, so no need for code reviews on this one.

The assignment is due at 9:00AM on Thursday. You should be able to finish the basics stories based on the video walkthrough from class. The advanced stories and beautiful styling will take significantly more time. We highly encourage you to make the best product you can!

You'll receive individual feedback on your submission by Friday evening.

Required Stories
[ ] The user can see a list of the 20 latest top news stories, loaded dynamically from newsapi.
[ ] For each story, the user sees a headline, the source, a link to more, and an image. 
[ ] The user can see the total number of stories currently shown.

Optional Stories
Feel free to experiment with stories here. They are roughly sorted in order of estimated difficulty.

[ ] The user can click a link at the bottom of the page to load the next 20 stories. The page should not refresh; the stories should simply be added to the bottom. 
[ ] The user can see an updated number of stories currently shown.
[ ] The user can see how long ago the story was published in a human-friendly format; e.g. "15 minutes ago". To accomplish this, we recommend you use momentjs. Please load it into your page using cdnjs or jsdelivr (these are called CDNs).

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the page!
